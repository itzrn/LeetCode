/**
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians).
 * The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.
 *
 * A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:
 *
 * The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
 * Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.
 * Return the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: mat =
 * [[1,1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,1,1,0],
 *  [1,0,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,1,1,1]],
 * k = 3
 * Output: [2,0,3]
 * Explanation:
 * The number of soldiers in each row is:
 * - Row 0: 2
 * - Row 1: 4
 * - Row 2: 1
 * - Row 3: 2
 * - Row 4: 5
 * The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: mat =
 * [[1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,1,1,1],
 *  [1,0,0,0],
 *  [1,0,0,0]],
 * k = 2
 * Output: [0,2]
 * Explanation:
 * The number of soldiers in each row is:
 * - Row 0: 1
 * - Row 1: 4
 * - Row 2: 1
 * - Row 3: 1
 * The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [0,2,3,1].
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * m == mat.length
 * n == mat[i].length
 * 2 <= n, m <= 100
 * 1 <= k <= m
 * matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
