/**
 * Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,2,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * The first distinct maximum is 3.
 * The second distinct maximum is 2.
 * The third distinct maximum is 1.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The first distinct maximum is 2.
 * The second distinct maximum is 1.
 * The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * The first distinct maximum is 3.
 * The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
 * The third distinct maximum is 1.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 104
 * -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Can you find an O(n) solution? -> use priority Queue
